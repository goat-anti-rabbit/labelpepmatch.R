Title: Tools For Interpreting Mass Spectra With Labelled Peptides
Description: Labelpepmatch is a package for the interpretation of nano-LC-MS spectra of peptides labelled with stable isotope tags. It takes as input a file with peaks with their m/z, retention time and signal quantity. Next to functions to detect peak pairs and mass match them to a database of known peptides, the package also contains appropriate statistics, inference and visualisation tools.
