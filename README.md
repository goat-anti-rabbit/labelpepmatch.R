# Labelpepmatch 0.1 (BETA)

A package for the for the interpretation of nano-LC-MS spectra of peptides labeled with stable isotope tags. It takes as input a file with peaks with their m/z, retention time and signal quantity. Next to functions to detect peak pairs and mass match them to a database of known peptides, the package also contains appropriate statistics, inference and visualisation tools.
